- This will also show how to take that commnad line string and convert it into a integer
- Useage of atoi, argc, argv[], char and if/else statments
- usage of boolan && ||

Counted Loop:
- Shows how a loop within C works
- how to increase a number each time a program is ran within a loop
- shows how "for" is used and "++"

Function call by value:
- Shows hwo to assign numbers to values and call those functions later in the code
- will retrevie values

Hello:
- The classic hello world
- shows how to have a program print a string of text when ran

Line Input:
- shows how to create an array of characters
- creating limits for that array

Number Guess:
- Shows how to set up a loop based on user input
- will continually run a loop until the number we are looking for is entered
- Will show "EOF" "&" "while" "if" "break" "else if" "%d"

Number Input: 
- Asking for inputs and assigning values based on those inputs

Pick a Number:
- Will ask for a number and then display the number entered

Read A File:
- Creates an array and will read a file up to the limit of that array
- Opens a file within its working directory
- "char line[]" "FILE *hand" "fopen" "fgets" "line" "hand" "NULL"

String Inpuut:
- Creates an array 
- prompts the user for an input
- will take the input string, store as variable
- display the string the user entered
